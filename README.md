# SNN Exploration

This wiki tracks the ongoing exploration of SNNs (Spiking Neural Networks) by W. Max Lees.

## Mathematical Models of Neurons
### Hodgkin-Huxley Model
A very accurate model of a spiking neuron created in 1952. Describes the dynamics of the different ion channels and for this reason is computationally expensive.

## Lit Review
This section contains links to all of the literature review.

### Surveys
[[Lee 2021 - A Survey on Spiking Neural Networks|Lit Review: A Survey on Spiking Neural Networks]]

### Reading List
Simple Model of Spiking Neurons - https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spikes.pdf  
Proposes a mathematical neuron model that is quick to compute but also highly biologically accurate.

## Code
This section contains links to design docs/descriptions of test code and potentially any results.

## Additional Links
Here are any additional links that I find useful and don't want to lose.
